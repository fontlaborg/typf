Note: ’@’ signals start of path but isn’t itself part of path. NEXT TASK: Sprint forward on @./PLAN.md and @./TODO.md tasks. Use @./WORK.md as the scratchpad for notes, clean it after completion. Check off or remove completed tasks in @./PLAN.md and @./TODO.md . Keep the NEXTTASK.md file as is, don’t edit it! Use browser tools; consult up-to-date docs; research topics. If all tasks are solved, plan 3 small important tasks and work on them. Run ./build.sh which at the end runs ./typf-tester/typfme.py and then inspect the JSONs, PNGs and SVGs in ./typf-tester/output/ folder to debug & improve. Look at bitmaps AND vectors and JSON data, not just one of them.
