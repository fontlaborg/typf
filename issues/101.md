Analyze the current codebase snapshot @./llms.txt and analyze the references in @./reference/renderers/ @./reference/haforu/ @./reference/01code/ then write new @./GOALS.md file that outlines the main objectives and directives and plans for our typf package. typf must be a top metapackage that encompasses at least 3 extremely performant backends that cover Unicode text preprocessing (run segmentation), fast font shaping (line layout), and extremely efficient rendering into both outlines (with SVG being the final output) and bitmaps. Backend 1 (typf-mac) must be in Rust and use CoreText on macOS. Backend 2 (typf-win) must in Rust and use DirectWrite on Windows. Backend 3, 4 etc. (typf-*) must be in Rust and use ICU & HarfBuzz Unicode segmentation into runs and then font shaping, and several different code paths to the final outputs. And then we want a Python package with optional extras that will provide performant bindings to the Rust code. Then update @./README.md and @./CLAUDE.md and @./PLAN.md so that these files align with @./GOALS.md and prioritize the direction outlined above. Then expand @./PLAN.md so that serves as an extremely detailed spec which will guide a developer step-by-step: how exactly to structure the project, how we plan to build the deliverables (we want to use Github Actions and semver releases based on git tags), how we lay out the code (both Rust and Python). @./PLAN.md must also include a very detailed spec on the actual code, all the phases and specifics, and must prioritze RAPID DEVELOPMENT so we get to goal as fast as possible. Then into @./TODO.md write a long detailed flat itemized list of tasks (each prefixed with `- [ ]`).
