Analyze @./TODO.md and @./PLAN.md and PLAN/00.md and also the @./PLAN folder: the files PLAN/01.md PLAN/02.md PLAN/03.md PLAN/04.md PLAN/05.md PLAN/06.md PLAN/07.md PLAN/08.md  PLAN/09.md —— then analyze and understand the reference code in @./external/ and then analyze in-depth the entire old codebase  that's in @./old-typf/ —— and then update PLAN/00.md PLAN/01.md PLAN/02.md PLAN/03.md PLAN/04.md PLAN/05.md PLAN/06.md PLAN/07.md PLAN/08.md  PLAN/09.md and finally update @./PLAN/00.md and @./PLAN.md and @./TODO.md —— so that the plan actually references the specific  locations within @./old-typf/ so the refactoring is easier. Then enhance @./CLAUDE.md with guidelines specific to this project, and adapt it to serve as a reference guide for 'typf'
