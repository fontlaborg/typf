We’ve created ./typf-tester/typfme.py that uses a test font and into @./typf-tester/ folder it outputs a full complement of renderings using various shaping and render backends, as both PNG and SVG. The typefme.py tool should also perform benchmarking of all backend combos across many sample texts and font sizes and produce a nice report into the @./typf-tester/ folder. Use that tool and inspect the outputs to debug and improve the shaping and rendering of all backgrounds. Work in a continuous feedback loop.
