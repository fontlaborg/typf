Analyze the current code (snapshot is in ./llms.txt ). 

Ultrathink and add to the @./PLAN.md that: 

- You write a `./build.sh` that builds everything (both Rust and Python), and prepares it for a release, in a canonical fashion; and write `./run.sh` that runs the libraries with some test data
- Ensure that the Rust lib has an efficient powerful CLI that’s generally compatible with the `hb-shape` and `hb-view` syntax
- Ensure that the Python bindings also has an efficient Powerful Fire-based CLI that’s similar to the above
- Ensure that the Rust and the Python bindings are installable via extras or options so that the Mac-specific and the Windows-specific versions are separately installable
- Ensure that the entire repo is organized in a canonical fashion that is compatible with best practices from Rust and Python
- Ensure that the Rust and the Python building is possible locally but also it’s possible via Github Actions especially for the release process
- Ensure that Rust and especially Python uses automatic semver that’s backed by git tags (using hatch vcs), and that Github Actions cut releases when I git-tag `vX.Y.Z`

Make sure that @./TODO.md is a flat itemized `- [ ]`-prefixed list of tasks that correspond to the plan. Then read @./NEXTTASK.md and follow it.
