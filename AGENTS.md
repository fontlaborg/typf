Analyze the entire 'typf' project and update @./REVIEW.md so it’s a very detailed, comprehensive, professional review of the QUALITY of each function, method, class, file, module, package, crate in the project. Be very meticulous, ultrathink, consult professional sources. Don’t perform any code changes, just write the review. When you’re done writing the complete review, step back, review the code once again, and refine revise the REVIEW.md. Then into @./PLAN.md write a detailed actionable plan that encompasses a comprehensive spec for improving the quality of the project.
